arduinoserial.py 
================

``arduinoserial.py`` is a Python port of `Tod E. Kurt's
arduino-serial.c program`_ for communicating with an Arduino
microcontroller board over a serial port. It only uses standard Python
modules (notably ``termios`` and ``fcntl``) and does not require any
special serial communications modules.


Like Tod's program, you can use it from the command line.

Send the string "a5050" to Arduino::

  $ ./arduinoserial.py -b 19200 -p /dev/tty.usbserial-A50018fz -s a5050

This would cause the pan-tilt head described in the `lemonodor post "Tilt"`_ to
return to its middle position.

Recieve a line of text from Arduino, wait 1000 milliseconds, then send
the string "a0000"::

  $ ./arduinoserial.py -b 19200 -p /dev/tty.usbserial-A50018fz -r -d 1000 -s a0000

Complete command line usage information::

  Usage: arduinoserial.py -p <serialport> [OPTIONS]
  Options:
    -h, --help                   Print this help message.
    -p, --port=SERIALPORT        Serial port Arduino is on.
    -b, --baud=BAUDRATE          Baudrate (bps) of Arduino.
    -s, --send=DATA              Send data to Arduino.
    -r, --receive                Receive data from Arduino & print it out.
    -n  --num=NUM                Send a number as a single byte.
    -d  --delay=MILLIS           Delay for specified milliseconds.

  Note: Order is important. Set '-b' before doing '-p'.
        Used to make series of actions:  '-d 2000 -s hello -d 100 -r'
        means 'wait 2 seconds, send 'hello', wait 100 msec, get reply'.

You can also import ``arduinoserial`` and use its ``SerialPort`` class
to communicate with an Arduino from a Python program::

  import arduinoserial

  arduino = arduinoserial.SerialPort('/dev/ttyUSB0', 19200)
  print arduino.read_until('\n')
  arduino.write('a5050')
